This monorepo contains both the frontend and backend of the application. Follow the instructions below to set up, develop, and deploy the project.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install

## Development

To start both the backend and frontend in development mode, use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch all necessary services for local development.

## Production

Before deploying the application, you need to build it using:

```sh
npm run build
```

Once the build process is complete, start the services with:

```sh
npm run start
```

This will run the application in production mode.
